# Frontend (Angular 18)

This is a minimal Angular 18 single-page app scaffold that demonstrates:

- JWT-based authentication (login -> token stored in localStorage)
- JWT interceptor that attaches Authorization header
- Employee CRUD pages (list, create, edit)
- Tailwind CSS for styling

To run:
1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm start

Note: This is a minimal scaffold for demo purposes. Replace with a full Angular CLI generated app for production use.
